# Slither Away

## About 

Slither Away is a classic snake game that was made using C++ on Dev-C++ using simple data structures like Arrays and selection control structures like switch statements. Furthermore, this game implements randomization features to create unique spawn positions for both the initial snake position and the fruit sprites.

## Run 
To run the game, open and run SnakeGame.cpp on Dev-C++. You can run by going to "Execute" at the top bar, then selecting "Compile & Run."
